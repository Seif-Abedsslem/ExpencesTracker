# Get to know some terms.
1. Git is a version control software library that tracks revisions and manages changes in a file.
1. GitHub is a website where you use gits tools to collaborate with other people working on a project.

You can think of a git repository as the folder for your project that contains all the component files such as code, documentation and examples, you can store your repository on GitHub, where they can be publicly visible or be private and only accessible to certain users.

When you start working on a project, you need to make your own branch of a repository, which is a parallel version that contains your changes. As you make modifications, like adding or deleting lines of code or files, you save or commit, your changes.

To propose integrating your commits into the production version of the project, known as the master branch, you open a pull request. A pull request is the way you start a discussion with others about your changes because you want them pulled into the master branch. Other collaborators on the project can review and approve your work.  After your pull request is merged, your changes are added to the master branch.

2. **PieChart**

A pie graph (or pie chart) is a specialized graph used in statistics. The independent variable is plotted around a circle in either a clockwise direction or a counterclockwise direction.The dependent variable (usually a percentage) is rendered as an arc whose measure is proportional to the magnitude of the quantity.

The illustration below is a **pie chart** depicting the results of our  **Expense Tracker** given to a hypothetical class of Categories.Each category is denoted by a "slice."The total of the percentages is equal to 100 (this is important; if it were not, the accuracy of the graph would be suspect).The total of the arc measures is equal to 360 degrees.
